\section{Project Specification}

\textbf{Aim}: To show simplified math equations on Network Graph\\
\\
\textbf{How to achieve it}
\
\begin{enumerate}

\item User will enter Latex in input box if that latex present in database then will receive Mathml data as AST from db Directly and need to represent on graph


\item If latex is not present in database then it will convert to Mathml first then that Mathml
Is simplified to its final equation using parser in return we will get AST of Mathml that we have to display those as Node and edges where Nodes represent mathml and edges represent relations between each equation.

\item If latex is not present in db then we have to follow step2 and need to store data in db
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Technologies}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Sigmajs/D3 js
\item NeoSigma4j/Postgress
\item Ocaml 
   
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Terminologies}

\section{Real analysis}

\paragraph{Real Number}
A real number is any positive or negative number. This includes all integers and all rational and irrational numbers. Rational numbers may be expressed as a fraction (such as $\frac{7}{8}$) and irrational numbers may be expressed by an infinite decimal representation $ (3.1415926535...)$

In general, all the arithmetic operations can be performed on these numbers and they can be represented in the number line, also. At the same time, the imaginary numbers are the un-real numbers, which cannot be expressed in the number line and is commonly used to represent a complex number. 
\\
\\
The set of real numbers are consist of different categories, such as, natural and whole numbers, rational and irrational numbers and integers.


\paragraph{Real analysis} Real analysis is a field in mathematics that focuses on the properties of real numbers, sequences and functions
\\
\\
Study of Real number system:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Natural Number: 1 to infinite also called counting numbers
 Whole Numbers: 0, 1,2 ... to infinite
\item Integer's:  negative infinite .... 0.... Positive infinite 
\item Rational number:  denoted By Q = $\frac{p}{q}$ where \item q is not equal to zero and p,q must be integers and p,q must not have any common factors
\item Irrational number: Which cannot be represented on p/q form like root 2

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Closure}
A set is closed under an operation if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of that set.\\
\textbf{example:} Integers are closed under addition but not under subtraction.
$$ 1+2 = 3 ; 993+2 =  995 $$
$$ 1-2 = -1 $$ Natural numbers are not closed under subtraction   
\\
\\
 A set is said to be closed under a collection of operations if it is closed under each of the operations individually.



 
\paragraph{Cauchy Sequence }
A sequence is said to be a cauchy sequence  for every epsilon greater than zero.There is a positive integer $m          m, n > N then |am- an| < ε. \forall  m>n$ \\
\\
First we will construct Natural Numbers:
\\
Constructing Real numbers with Peano’s Axiom
\
\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

\textbf{Axioms:}
\\*
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exist a natural number 1
\item If a is a natural number, then its successor  s(a) = a+1 is also a natural number.
\item 1 is not the successor is any natural number
\item If two numbers have the same successor then they must be the same number.
\item Given a set S, if 1 belongs to S and contains the successor of any number in S then S must contain all of the natural numbers.\\
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Construction of Integers }
We assume that the set of natural numbers
\\
$$ \mathbb{N} =  \{0,1,2,3,4...\} $$
\\
Subtraction. Subtraction is defined as the inverse operation to addition.
By definition, $a − b$ is a number x such that $x + b = a$. In other words, a − b is a solution to the equation
$$x + b = a$$


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the set N\times N of ordered pairs of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}^2  (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}
    
    So the elements of this set are ordered pair natural numbers

    \item  . Consider the equivalence relation ∼ on this set defined by
       $(m, n)$ equivalent  if and only if $ m + q = n + p$
       
    \item The equivalence classes from this equivalence relations
    are \textbf{integer's}
    
    \item We can define additions and multiplications on these equivalnce classes
    
  $$  [(m, n)] + [(p, q)] = [(m + p, n + q)] $$
  
   And Mutiplication
  
  $$  [(m, n)] · [(p, q)] = [(mp + nq, np + mq)] $$
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{Some basic definition:}

\textbf{Least element}:  Let A is subset of Q where Q is a set of all Rational number, r  Q then r is said to be least element of A only if
$$r {\in} A:r {\leq x} ,{\forall} x {\in} A$$. \\   
\\
\\
\textbf{Largest element:}  Let A is subset of Q where Q is a set of all Rational number, $ u {\in} Q $ then u is said to be Largest element of A only if
$$u {\in} A
u {\geq} x, \forall x \in A $$
\\
\\*
(This definition is in my own words may be not like standard definition)\\
\\
\textbf{Dedekind Cuts:}  Since the set of rational is an ordered field so  we can arrange this set of rational number Q on number line. Suppose we mark a cut P on that number line such that it divides number line in two parts or in two sub set of Q.
\\
What we will have after dividing the number line:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There will be two part one on left hand “L” called lower class element and other on Right hand side “U” called Upper class elements.

\item Lower class “L” elements are smaller that Upper class elements “U”.

\item There are two possibilities for cut “P”. It could be Rational number or irrational number.

\item If P is irrational number then all rational either belongs to “L” or belongs “U” and P itself become the largest element of U.

\item If cut P is a rational number then means P is in the form of p/q
Then P belongs to “U”. Means P will be element of Right hand set
\pagebreak

\textbf{Standard Definition from above explanation}
\\
A Dedekind cut x = (L, U) in Q is a pair of subset L,U of Q satisfying the following condition
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L \cup U$ = Q ,  $L \cap U$ = {}, L and U are non empty sets
\item If l belongs L and u belongs U then $l<u$
\item L will not have the largest element 


\end{enumerate}

\section{HOL Light}
Referencing link for HOL LIGHT:   https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/
\\
\\
Basic
Author: John Harrison 
\\
\\
\\
\\
HOL Light is a computer program to help users prove interesting mathematical theorems completely formally in higher order logic. It sets a very exacting standard of correctness, but provides a number of automated tools and pre-proved mathematical theorems (e.g. about arithmetic, basic set theory and real analysis)
\pagebreak

\textbf{HOL Light Basics}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Terms}
\\
Terms are like  strings  in  that  they  are  manipulated  purely  as  symbolic  expressions.

$$ {`}x+1{`} $$   

\item \textbf{Types}
\\
A key feature of HOL is that every term has a well-definedtype.  Roughly speaking,the type indicates what kind of mathematical object the term represents (a number, aset, a function, etc.)  The possible types of terms are represented using another sym-bolic datatypeholtype, and these will similarly be automatically parsed and printedwithin backquotes with a colon as the first character.


\begin{verbatim}  type_of ‘1‘;;
val it : hol_type = ‘:num‘# 
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim} type_of ‘x + 1 < x + 2‘;;
val it : hol_type = ‘:bool‘
\end{verbatim}


\item \textbf{Theorems}\\
 A specialtypethm(‘theorem’) is used for formulas
 
\textbf{REFL}
\begin{verbatim}
    # let th1 = REFL ‘x + 1‘;;
val th1 : thm = |- x + 1 = x + 1
\end{verbatim}


\textbf{ASSUME}
\begin{verbatim}
# let th2 = ASSUME ‘2 * n = n + n‘;;
val th2 : thm = 2 * n = n + n |- 2 * n = n + n
\end{verbatim}


\begin{verbatim}
# REFL ‘x:real‘;;
val it : thm = |- x = x 
# let th1 = REFL ‘x + 1‘;;
val th1 : thm = |- x + 1 = x + 1
\end{verbatim}

\item \textbf{tautologies}\\

A formula of propositional logic is a tautology if the formula itself is always true regardless of which valuation is used for the propositional variables.

\\
Symbols used in HOL light

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
\⊥\ & F & Falsity\\
> & T & Truth\\
¬& ˜ & Not\\
∧ & /\ &And\\
∨& \/ & Or\\
⇒ & ==\>\ & Implies (‘if . . . then . . . ’)\\
⇔ & <=> & Iff (‘. . . if and only if . . . ’)\\


\begin{verbatim}
    # TAUT ‘(p <=> q) <=> (p ==> q) /\ (q ==> p)‘;;
val it : thm = |- (p <=> q) <=> (p ==> q) /\ (q ==> p)
\end{verbatim}

The following says that ‘p if and only if q’ is equivalent to ‘if p then q’ and ‘if q
then p’ together

\begin{verbatim}
    # TAUT ‘p \/ q ==> p /\ q‘;;
Exception: Failure "REFINEMENT_PROOF: Unsolved goals".

TAUT  `p \/ p `;;
Returns -> Exception: Failure "TAC_PROOF: Unsolved goals".

\end{verbatim}
If the user supplies a non-tautology to TAUT then it will simply fail to return a
theorem at all:

\end{enumerate}




HOL Light Code

Worked on compiling an \texttt{incr\_dom} dom file with HOL Light and intro.ml.
First checked how to compile \texttt{incr\_dom} with file HOL light and use input from
web to HOL light and print result on web.\\
\\
As hol light consist of lots of files and so currently i dont know how
pass web input to Hol light.\\
\\
In order to work with hol light theorem prover first i have tested how to use
\texttt{incr\_dom}  with intro.ml\\
\\
\\
Used files:\\
\\
Intro.ml from sml handbook\\
